# jvulkan-examples

jvulkan-examples is a collection of Java programs that demonstrate the use of the jvulkan Java Vulkan SDK project.  The program files are more or less all of the different examples explored in the Vulkan Tutorial that can be found online (in c++).

## Installation


In addition to this library you will need to retrieve and build the 
jvulkan-natives-Linux-x86_64 project and the jvulkan project.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
